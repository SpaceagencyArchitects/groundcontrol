# DRAWING DESCRIPTION

Use generic material and system descriptions (e.g.‘lining’, ‘ceiling’, ‘cladding’, ‘roof sheeting’), followed by the legend sheet code describing the system or material, followed by the generic description of the finish, followed by the legend sheet finishes code:

# WRITING STYLE

Apply consistent writing style, with particular attention to wording and consistent use of terms.

For the vast majority of written description of the building elements, we use combinations of the generic names (CLADDING, FLOORING, UPHOLSTERY), systems and materials codes (EWS- 3, FL-3, UP-5), descriptors (PAINTED, FIXED) and the finishes codes (PT-4, COL-1) 

Write instructions in simple, clear, direct short sentences, following the principle “one expression, one simple meaning”. Avoid the use of abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are listed and described on the legend sheet.

# ABBREVIATIONS AND CODES

Use abbreviations only as they are listed on the legend sheet. Use the legend sheet codes for describing systems, materials and finishes.

# FONT SIZE

The minimum font size is 2.0mm when printed at full size. Detail titles should be 3.5mm high. The general rule is that the text has to remain legible (without a magnifying glass) when reduced to half size.

# TEXT ORIENTATION

To maintain legibility and uniformity, any text on a drawing has to be either horizontal or rotated 90° counterclockwise:

# DO NOT ADD NOTES SUCH AS ‘AS SPECIFIED’, ‘AS SCHEDULED’ OR ‘REFER TO ENGINEERS DETAILS’

Every component of the project is either specified or scheduled or documented by other consultants. Notes like that are redundant and potentially hazardous, as the works may be missing from other documents.

When issuing an instruction, follow the examples below.
Avoid repeating specification information on drawings and details.

Examples:

Use the active voice of verbs rather than the passive:
DO NOT USE: TO BE PAINTED TO MATCH EXISTING
PREFERRED: PAINT TO MATCH EXISTING

Be assertive in using commands rather than weaker instructions:
DO NOT USE: HAND WASH BASINS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED
PREFERRED: DO NOT REMOVE HAND WASH BASINS

Phrase directions around action verbs rather than abstract nouns
DO NOT USE: UTILISATION, ALIGNMENT, AVOIDANCE, PROTECTION
PREFERRED: USE, ALIGN, AVOID, PROTECT

Speak directly to contractors rather than saying what they might do
DO NOT USE: WINDOW FRAMES TO BE REMOVED AND OPENINGS MADE GOOD BY DEMOLITION CONTRACTOR
PREFERRED: REMOVE WINDOW FRAMES AND MAKE GOOD OPENINGS

Avoid double negatives
DO NOT USE: DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS APPROVED
PREFERRED: INSTALL APPROVED SYSTEM
