title: "Drawing and Describing Architectural Entities"
---
Construction documentation consists of two principal parts: drawings and specifications
# Architectural Drawing Set

The _architectural drawing_ set is autonomous. It communicates to the contractor comprehensive representation of the future building. The architectural drawing set incorporates listing of all codes used to describe the building through detailed description of the architectural entities. The architectural drawing set includes relevant ‘assembly of elements’ schedules.
# Architectural Specifications

The _architectural specification_ is a written document with technical directions and conditions describing the quality of materials and standard of workmanship of a project. It deals with items that are not shown on drawings or ‘assembly of elements’ schedules.
# Architectural Entity

Architectural Entity (e.g. Reception, Main Entrance, Classroom, External Wall, Auditorium) is a collection of selected building elements (e.g. timber slats, metal studs, plasterboard sheets, coats of paint, ceiling tiles, etc.), assembled together in predetermined configuration.

The above definitions highlight the Architectural documentation paradox:

Drawings = architectural entities
Specifications = trade packages

# Complete Information

We do not subdivide our drawing set to document isolated information specific to individual trades.

# Concentrate on Architecture

The design intent is expressed through providing:
- Dimensional setting-out of visible surfaces
- Definition of materials
- Definition of finishes

Everything else (i.e. structural design of fixings, internal profiling of aluminium extrusions, exact number of rubber blades within a gasket, etc.) is either in the job description of specialist consultants, contractors, construction managers, etc

# Describing Architectural Entities

The _architectural drawing_ set describes the architectural entities of the project through a set of continuously upgraded documents, regardless of what any contractor, at any stage, may wish to separate into a trade package.

# Specification

Architectural specification is presented as a sequence of trades. The specification forms part of the tender and contract documents.

# Tracking of Revisions

- Cloud the changes
- Show a revision triangle with revision number
- Write brief description of changes in the description column
- avoid meaningless descriptions like ‘GENERAL REVISIONS’

# Communication

Depending on the type of contract, we are often commissioned by the client to act as a _lead consultant_, which places on us the responsibility to coordinate the design information of the entire design team. The clarity of communication between us and the other consultants, and the clear delineation between our and their information is crucially important for the success of the documentation stage of the project.

Do not repeat other consultant’s design information on our drawings.
