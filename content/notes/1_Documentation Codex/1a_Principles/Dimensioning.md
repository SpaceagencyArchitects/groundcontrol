title: "Dimensioning"
---
#### Use Grids and Centre Lines
Allow the building to ‘dimension itself’ as much as possible.

#### Priority Dimensioning and Open Dimensions
Concentrate on critical dimensions (e.g. width of escape corridor). Leave non-critical dimension out of the dimension string.

#### Restrict the Use of RLs
Use relative heights ‘above finished floor level’ (AFFL) e.g. dimension the height of a handrail in millimetres.

#### Identify Dimensions Which Are Not Known
Dimensions to be determined during the construction

#### Set-out Openings to the Critical Side only
Do not dimension structural opening for doors and windows.

#### Describe Intended Outcome
Use descriptions like ALIGN or MATCH THE HEIGHT OF EXISTING ARCHITRAVE , do not rely on dimensions only

#### Clarity
Do not describe a dimension as ‘nominal’. If it is of importance, state MINIMUM or MAXIMUM.
