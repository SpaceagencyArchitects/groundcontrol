title: "Sheet Numbering"
---
Elements of the drawing numbers described here are essential for successful navigation within the set.
There are two different numbering system. Choose the system that best suits the size an complexity of the project. The adopted numbering system needs to be consistent throughout the drawing set.

# The SpA Classic Method
Drawing Numbers are composed using the following designators:
**(Discipline)(Sheet Type)(Sequence Number)**
eg. A101

The **Discipline designator** helps to identify the type of work that is included on the sheets. Since sheets are distributed to the different sub-contractors in the field, it is helpful for the drawings to be organized by discipline. SpA only produces drawings designated 'A'

The **Sheet Types designator** organizes drawings into categories - generally from most general to most specific or specialised. Since plans are most helpful to see the overall design of the project, they come first. Elevations and sections are a bit more specific and come next followed by details and schedules, which are the most specific type of drawings.

Sheet Types designators used for spaceagency drawings are:
- 0 - General: Symbol legend, abbreviations, general notes
- 1 - Plans (including Floor, Roof, Ceilings, Electrical)
- 2 - Elevations
- 3 - Sections
- 4 - Large Scale Drawings: plans, elevations, sections (NOT details, eg. stairs, metalwork)
- 5 - Details
- 6 - Room Layouts and Elevations
- 7 - Door and Window Schedules
- 8 - Finishes Schedules
- 9 - 3D drawings: isometric, perspective, photos

The final component of the sheet number is the two-digit **sequence number**, which is between 01 and 99. The sequence numbers do not have to be sequential so that space may be left within the set for future additions.

## Example Sheet Numbers

A107 - Architectural Floor Plan, seventh sheet
A204 - Architectural Elevations, fourth sheet

# The SpA Alphabet Method
The Alphabet method relates to the groups of drawings described in the SpA Alphabet. It is more suitable for larger, more complex projects that require a greater range of drawings to desribe the project.
Drawing numbers are composed using the following designators:

**(Discipline).(SpA Alphabet Series).(Sequential Number)**
eg. A.D.10


The **Discipline designator** helps to identify the type of work that is included on the sheets. Since sheets are distributed to the different sub-contractors in the field, it is helpful for the drawings to be organized by discipline. SpA only produces drawings designated 'A'

The **SpA Alphabet Series designator** identifies which drawing group the drawing belongs to

Designators are:
[A (A0 Introductory documents](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/A%20(A0%20Introductory%20documents.md)
[B - Floor and Roof Plans](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/B%20-%20Floor%20and%20Roof%20Plans.md)
[C - External Elevations](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/C%20-%20External%20Elevations.md)
[D - Sections](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/D%20-%20Sections.md)
[E - Reflected Ceiling Plans](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/E%20-%20Reflected%20Ceiling%20Plans.md)
[F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md)
[G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md)
[H - Cores, Stairs and Lifts](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/H%20-%20Cores,%20Stairs%20and%20Lifts.md)
[J - Doors and Windows](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/J%20-%20Doors%20and%20Windows.md)
[K - Interface Details](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/K%20-%20Interface%20Details.md)
[L - Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment (FFE)](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/L%20-%20Furniture,%20Fixtures,%20Fittings%20and%20Equipment%20(FFE).md)
[M - Joinery](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/M%20-%20Joinery.md)
[N - Metalwork](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/N%20-%20Metalwork.md)
P - not in use
Q - not in use
[R - Miscellaneous](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/R%20-%20Miscellaneous.md)
[S - Signage](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/S%20-%20Signage.md)
[T - Landscape](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/T%20-%20Landscape.md)
[U - Resource Management (formerly Demolition)](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/U%20-%20Resource%20Management%20(formerly%20Demolition).md)
[V - Concrete, Framing and Waterproofing Plans](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/V%20-%20Concrete,%20Framing%20and%20Waterproofing%20Plans.md)

The final component of the sheet number is the two-digit **sequence number**, which is between 01 and 99. The sequence numbers do not have to be sequential so that space may be left within the set for future additions.

Added complexity (such as ‘Zone’, ‘Phase’, ‘Wing’, etc.) of projects can be incorporated into the main drawing number (e.g. A-WW-B-18, WW being West Wing).

In ArchiCAD, layouts are set up so that navigation denominators for section and detail markers only display the referred drawings SpA Alphabet denominator and sequence number, eg. B-18.
