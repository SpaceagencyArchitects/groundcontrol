# The Benefits of Producing a Storyboard:

The purpose of storyboarding is to provide the team with
the following information:
- Drawing numbers
- Drawing titles
- Layout and titles of drawings within a drawing sheet (up to **1:20** scale)

The storyboard shows the global picture.
It eradicates the need to reinvent the rules.
Naming conventions are consistent throughout the set.
In the general storyboard, sheets of details (a scale larger than **1:20**) are only numbered and inserted into the set.

The starting point for the storyboard of every project is the default layout set in the current ArchiCAD template. Depending on the size of the project, the storyboard can use the Classic or Alphabet numbering system.
# Planning

Plan the documentation process
Plan the management of the consultants’ input
Review the consultants’ input and incorporate it into the architectural drawing set.
Do not repeat consultants’ detailed information such as column sizes or purlin layouts.

# First Decide on the Sheet Size

The size of paper is a function of the physical size of your building and scale of the general arrangement plan. Once decided, the size of paper must remain consistent.
Do not mix the sizes of paper within the set.

# The General Storyboard

Break the drawing set into drawing groups as per the SpA Alphabet. Design the storyboard at the required paper size. This becomes the skeleton of your future drawing set.

# Detailed Building Component Storyboard

The coordinating architects in charge of documentation of a particular building component (e.g. external wall, ceilings, etc.) produce their own storyboard, within the framework of the general storyboard.
