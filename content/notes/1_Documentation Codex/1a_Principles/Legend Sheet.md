The legend sheet is an essential part of the drawing set.

The most important part is the list of codes. This list is the central depository and the single point of reference to understanding all systems, materials and finishes used on the project.

#### The Legend Sheet Includes:
- Drawing list (SpA Alphabet) of drawing groups contained within the drawing set. This is for quick reference, to enable easier navigation around the set.
- List of abbreviations
- List of all systems, materials and finishes codes including reference to the specification section where the systems, materials and finishes are fully specified
- Key to drawing symbols e.g. door tags, elevation reference symbols, etc
- Key to drawing graphics and conventions e.g. concrete hatching, direction of ramp fall, etc
- Key to reflected ceiling symbols. This varies from project to project. There is no standard library of ceiling symbols. The symbols have to be developed separately for every project. It is beneficial to base your symbols on equivalent-ones created (and drawn) by the services engineers.
- General project notes
