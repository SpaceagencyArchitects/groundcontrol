#### Referencing

Referencing is the means of bringing the user’s attention to another drawing elsewhere in the drawing set that shows additional information.

#### One Way Referencing

Always reference from a larger scale drawing to a more detailed-one, e.g. from **1:100** floor plan in ‘B’ series to corresponding **1:50** plan in ‘G’ series.

Always reference ‘one step at a time’. In the example above, make reference to **1:20** detail of a joinery item in ‘M’ series, but only from ‘G’ series. Do not draw ‘a box within a box’ in ‘B’ series general arrangement plan.

#### Do Not Back-reference

Back-referencing is an attempt to advise the user about the drawing number where the detail was referenced from. That piece of information is of a very little use to anyone and very difficult to keep accurate.

The same detail may be referenced from multiple locations in the project which would mean you need to list in every instance the origin of the detail. Backtracking is redundant as it would ultimately take you to the general arrangement plans anyway.

‘Verbal’ back-referencing is allowable, eg. by describing the origin of the detail in the detail title.
