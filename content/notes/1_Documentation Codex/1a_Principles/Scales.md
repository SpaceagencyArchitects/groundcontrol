# Scales

The drawing scales listed in the SpA Alphabet and Building Components are prescriptive

General arrangement plans have to be shown at **1:100**.

If a portion of the drawing becomes graphically too heavy due to small rooms and the required amount of description, draw a reference box to the same area enlarged at **1:50** and provide all description at the larger scale.

# Justification of Scale

Justify an increase of scale by providing additional information. A bigger scale is justified when general arrangement drawings get graphically too heavy.
