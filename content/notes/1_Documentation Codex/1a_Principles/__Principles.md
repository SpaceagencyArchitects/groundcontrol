# Benefits of Following the SpA Documentation Approach

- Efficient communication of design intent through legible, simple, clear documents
- Focus is on design, buildability and scope, rather than the drafting process
- Standardisation of the documentation output of the studio
- Allows an appropriate allocation of project risk
- Reduced number of conflicts and ambiguities, resulting in fewer contractual claims
- Flexibility to accommodate design changes throughout the construction documentation stage
- Better project outcomes

# Departure from the SpA Documentation Approach

There are many facets to construction documentation and many aspects which influence the way the construction documentation set will evolve. The project and contract type, builder’s preferences, consultant’s preferences, will all play a part in the sculpting of the document. Adjustments to suit a particular project are inevitable.

The decision to depart from the SpA documentation format is at the discretion of the project leader and will depend on the requirements of the project.

# Guides Not Rules

Concepts outlined in this document are principles, not rigid rules. They provide a base line for tested and efficient ways of completing the project documentation tasks.
