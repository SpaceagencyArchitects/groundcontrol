title: "Drafting of Details"
---
#### Level of Detail

Draw technical diagrams, not pictures (e.g. sections and elevations do not need to be highly embellished with lots of linework, textures or details, particularly as they are likely to change during documentation).
Generally show only what needs to be shown for building purposes.

#### 3D Drawings

Three-dimensional drawings are not generally used in construction documentation.
However, there are instances where the use of axonometric, isometric or perspective diagrams are justified as a means to clarify complex details shown elsewhere in plan, elevation and section.

#### Draw the ‘special’ Items

Don’t replicate standard construction details or information provided as part of a proprietary system
(e.g. if construction detail of a drylined partition you are using is already well drawn in CSR’s Red Book, there is no need to copy their detail).

#### Resolution of Detail

First resolve details and junctions on paper or ‘off-line’ and determine whether they are required for the drawing set.

#### Identify Orientation of Detail

Every detail needs to be explicit whether it is a plan or section
