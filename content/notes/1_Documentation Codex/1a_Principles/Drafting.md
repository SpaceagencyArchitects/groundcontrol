#### Nested Arrangement

Wherever practical, especially in scales **1:50** and **1:25**, combine plan(s), elevation(s) and section(s) to a ‘nested’ arrangement. That is a very efficient way to communicate the three dimensional design concepts.

#### Design Intent

Describe outcomes, rather than telling contractors in excessive detail how to achieve them - don’t assume responsibility for their work. Generally show only what needs to be shown for building purposes.
