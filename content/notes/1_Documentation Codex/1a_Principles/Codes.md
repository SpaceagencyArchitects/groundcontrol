Codes provide a link between a detail, a long description on the legend sheet and the full description in the specification.

# BENEFITS

- Codes increase flexibility, efficiency and accuracy and accommodate design changes during the Construction Documentation phase. For instance:
	- A portion of a façade is given the code CLAD-2 and described on the legend sheet as ‘COMPOSITE ALUMINIUM SANDWICH PANEL’. CLAD-2 as description will be frequently used in numerous parts of the Architectural Drawing Set.
	- Should the cladding change to ‘PATTERNATED STAINLESS STEEL PANEL WITH BACKING BOARD’, only the CLAD-2 description on the legend sheet and to the specifications needs to be updated, the description elsewhere in the drawing set does not need to change.
	- Only the legend sheet and specifications need to be re-issued and the rest of the drawing set is automatically up-to-date.
- Specification writers prefer code because it gives them an all-inclusive listing of systems, materials and finishes, and consequently assures completeness of the specifications.

# SYSTEMS, MATERIALS AND FINISHES CODES

A system is a set of parts that perform a specific function within a building. It consists of a number of selected building elements, assembled together in a pre-determined configuration, e.g. EXTERNAL WALL CLADDING SYSTEM, DRAINAGE SYSTEM, RAISED FLOOR SYSTEM

Material category describes in generic terms what a building element is made of – e.g. METAL, TIMBER, PLASTERBOARD, RECONSTITUTED STONE

Finish describes the required appearance of a material – e.g. HONED, POLISHED, MATT, GLOSS, BLUE, PINK

The use of ‘systems’ rather than ‘materials’ is often beneficial, since it generally offers greater flexibility.

# ABBREVIATIONS

The legend sheet also lists abbreviations used in the Architectural Drawing Set. Abbreviations are a shortened form of a word used in the annotation. 

Eg SYM is short for SYMMETRICAL

‘Codes’ should not be confused with ‘abbreviations’.
