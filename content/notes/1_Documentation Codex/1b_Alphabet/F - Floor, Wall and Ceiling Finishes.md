## FLOOR, WALL AND CEILING FINISHES - ROOM SCHEDULE SCENARIO

This is the preferred scenario for scheduling finishes.

- Simple description of finishes by coding the floor, wall and ceiling substrate materials and finishes in each room in a spreadsheet.
- The **Room schedule spreadsheet** lists every space (ArchiCAD zones), identified by name and number (matching the room names and numbers shown on the plans).
- The schedule presents a comprehensive list of spaces in the project.
- It makes reference to [G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md) drawings.
- Materials and finishes codes allocated to the rooms in the room schedule spreadsheet sufficiently describe substrate and finishes in majority of cases.
- For more complex internal spaces (e.g. lift lobby, auditorium), instead of trying to code it, draw the space at 1:50 scale in G series and write a referring note in the room schedule schedule spreadsheet, eg ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING A-G-xx’)

## FLOOR FINISHES - GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION SCENARIO (1:100)

If finishes are too complex to schedule, we can document them via graphic representation on [G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md) drawings or a subset of 1:100 plans in [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md), used exclusively to identify floor finishes. These drawings include:
-   Grid lines
-   Room names and room numbers
-   Change/delineation between finishes
-   Floor finishes codes
-   Stair numbers, lift numbers, escalator numbers
-   Section reference symbols referring to K series interface details

## WALL PROTECTION PLANS - (GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION SCENARIO) 1:100

If the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (e.g. in a health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex to schedule, we can document it through graphic representation.

This approach creates another subset of 1:100 plans in the [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md), used to graphically represent and identify wall protection systems. These drawings include:
-   Grid lines
-   Room names and room numbers
-   Wall protection systems codes
-   Stair numbers, lift numbers, escalator numbers
-   Section reference symbols referring to K series interface details
