## SIGNAGE (WAYFINDING) 1:20 1:5

Wayfinding signage elements will often be documented by a signage consultant. In that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans.

Statutory signage e.g. FIRE DOORS KEEP CLOSED, etc., is most often associated with the doors and is scheduled as part of the J series door schedule.
