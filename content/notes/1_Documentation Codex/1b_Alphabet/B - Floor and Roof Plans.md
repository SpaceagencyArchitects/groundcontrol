(Alphabet Drawings: A.B.01-A.B.99)**
### GENERAL ARRANGEMENT FLOOR PLANS (1:100)

-   Grid lines
-   Boundary line - at ground level only
-   Room names and room numbers
-   Finished floor level (FFL)
-   Slab penetrations/voids
-   Change of level indicators
-   Partition types
-   Partition critical dimensions and setting-out
-   Plan setting-out of wayfinding signage elements
-   Door numbers
-   Doors horizontal dimensional setting-out - offsets from grid lines and to critical side of the door frame only
-   Windows and external doors horizontal dimensional setting-out - offsets from grid lines only (See C and K series for windows description)
-   Joinery codes (If showing joinery at 1:100 makes drawing graphically heavy, do not show here. Create a 1:100 subset of general arrangement joinery drawings in L series)
-   Wayfinding signage - free standing and wall hung; show codes and setting-out dimensions
-   Stair numbers, lift numbers, escalator numbers
-   ‘Enlarged area boxes’ referring to 1:50 enlarged plans in B series if required (Do not show any description inside the box at 1:100 scale. Only applicable if an area of floor plan becomes graphically heavy at 1:100)
-   Main section references to 1:100 sections in D series drawings
-   External elevation references to 1:100 elevations in C series drawings
-   Ramp falls
-   Change/delineation between finishes
-   Graphical differentiation between the existing structure and the new build
-   Graphical differentiation between concrete and the other types of partition
-   Architectural metalwork systems codes (If showing metalwork at 1:100 makes drawing graphically heavy, do not show here, create a 1:100 subset of general arrangement metalwork drawings in N series)

### ROOF PLANS (1:100)

-   Grid lines
-   Ridge/parapet levels
-   Roofing systems, material and finishes codes
-   Rain water outlets and similar hydraulic systems codes
-   Roof mounted mechanical exhaust systems codes
-   Ratio or percentage of roof falls
-   Steps/change of level indicators
-   Catwalks/access systems/roof maintenance tracks/ladders/metalwork/ abseiling anchor rails and similar items codes
-   Architectural metalwork systems codes
-   Fall arrest systems codes
-   Main section references to 1:100 sections in D series drawings
-   External elevation references to 1:100 elevations in C series drawings
-   Critical dimensions and setting-out
-   Graphical differentiation between the existing structure and the new build
