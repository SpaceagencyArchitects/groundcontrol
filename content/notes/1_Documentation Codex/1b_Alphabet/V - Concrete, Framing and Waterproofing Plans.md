## CONCRETE AND WATERPROOFING PLANS 1:100

-   Grid lines
-   Setdowns
-   Top of structural slab level (SSL=)
-   Concrete upstands/hobs
-   Ramps
-   Movement/building joints
-   Indicate falls and gradients of slab/screed
-   General note about levelling screed stating finished screed level (FSL=) if applied uniformly on entire slab or,
-   Graphically differentiate areas with levelling screed and indicate finished screed levels (FSL=)
-   Graphic representation and waterproofing codes - to slab on ground areas and to wet areas
-   Services penetrations - mechanical, electrical, hydraulic
-   Horizontal dimensions of slab edges, penetrations, door openings and similar, from grid lines
-   ‘Enlarged area boxes’ referring to V series 1:50 plans (if required)
-   ‘Enlarged area boxes’ referring to H series 1:50 plans for stairs setting-out and details
-   Section symbols referring to K series 1:10 or 1:5 details of intricate edge conditions
-   Internal elevation symbols referring to V series 1:50 concrete elevations (if applicable)

## CONCRETE SLAB REFLECTED CEILING PLANS 1:100

Depending on the configuration of the building, there may be a requirement for showing areas of underside of concrete slab that need thermal insulation.

-   Grid lines
-   Reflected ceiling plan showing beams and slab thickening
-   Movement/building joints
-   Thermal insulation codes showing areas to be insulated

## CONCRETE SETTING-OUT ELEVATIONS 1:50

Only if required - e.g. mechanical penetrations through concrete core wall and similar.

-   Grid lines
-   Floor and Structural Slab Level (SSL=) benchmark indicators
-   Finished Screed Level (FSL=) benchmark indicators
-   Horizontal and vertical dimensions from grid lines and above SSL
-   Internal elevation symbols referring to other 1:50 concrete elevations within V series

## LIFT SHAFT EXTERNAL ELEVATIONS 1:50

-   Grid lines
-   Floor and structural slab Level (SSL=) benchmark indicators
-   Finished screed level (FSL=) benchmark indicators
-   Vertical dimensions above structural slab level (SSL) defining the size of penetrations required for lift doors and controls
