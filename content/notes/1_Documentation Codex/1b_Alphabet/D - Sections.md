**Classic Drawings: A301-A350**
**Alphabet Drawings: A.D.01-A.D.50**
## SECTIONS (1:100)

**Classic Drawing Subset: A301-A350**
**Alphabet Drawing Subset: A.D.01-A.D.50**

- Grid lines
- Finished floor level benchmarks
- Room names (Indicate major spaces only - the purpose of showing the room names is to aid the orientation)
- ‘Enlarged area boxes’ (ArchiCAD worksheet markers) referring to 1:50 sections. (If a portion of the drawing at 1:100 becomes graphically too heavy due to the required amount of description, draw an ‘enlarged area reference box’, do not show any description within the box at 1:100, and show description items on a 1:50 detail drawing.)
- Reference markers referring to 1:5 plan and section details in [K - Interface Details](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/K%20-%20Interface%20Details.md) (only if referencing to 1:5 detail without intermediate stop at 1:50 scale)
- Graphical differentiation between existing structure and new build

Note:
On smaller projects 1:100 sections may be omitted altogether in favour of 1:50 sections.
