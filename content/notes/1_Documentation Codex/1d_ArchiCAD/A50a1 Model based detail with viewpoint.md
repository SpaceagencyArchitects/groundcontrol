title: "A50a1 Model based detail with viewpoint"
---
Model based detailing requires the model to be developed to a high level of detail.
This workflow uses an amplified (enlarged) model-based source views (floor plans, sections, elevations, interior elevations). Additional information (2D elements, labels, dimensions, text, etc) is added directly into the source view on a separate layer(s) (eg. 5 Details for 1:10 and 1:5 detail drawings).

A detail **source** marker is placed on the source view, using the layer of the plan or section that it will appear on (eg. 5 GA Plans, 5 GA Markers). 
The detail generated by the source marker is placed on a layout.
This workflow creates detail content that is in the correct relative position in the BIMx model.

Any editing of the detail in the detail view should be avoided as it would break the direct connection to the model. All changes should be made in the model-based source view (floor plan or section), and the detail updated using the 'rebuilt from model' option.

Step 1
Setup a model-based source view (most typically a floor plan or a section) with the appropriate settings (i.e. layer combination, scale, pen set, model view, graphic override, renovation status, partial structure display)
*Note: In the spaceagency ArchiCAD template amplified views are already set up for Plan and Section Details (1:5 or 1:10) as well as Stair Drawings (1:25).*

Step 2
In the source view, add additional information and enhance the graphic representation of the detail. Associative labels and dimensions are useful to display more information about the elements and their properties. Other 2D elements can be added to enhance the detail with additional elements that are rarely modelled, such as screws, membranes, etc. 2D Elements from the libraries can be useful here, too. Ensure that these elements are placed on the appropriate detail layers (eg. *5 Details*), which are not shown on the high-level general arrangement views.

Step 3
Create a detail view by placing a **source marker** with the *Detail Tool* on the area we want to show in this view. To transfer all the 2D data we have placed on the source view into our detail view, make sure to untick the ‘Copy construction elements only’ option in the Detail Settings.
It is essential to work only in the source view when adding more data or making changes, never in the final detail view. After finishing or updating the enhancements and annotations, the detail must be rebuild from source view.

Step 4
Save a viewpoint of the detail and place it on a layout.

ADVANTAGES
- As the source view of the generated detail still has a live relation to the model, the detail view will always reflect any model changes, as long as it is correctly rebuilt from the source view.    
- All documentation is stored in the same file (unless a split model/layout book strategy is used to manage file sizes in large projects). 
- All model information can be used as a basis for detail information.
- Element properties can be queried (e.g. using Labels) in the source view, not in the detail view.  
- Consistency among all views: floor plans, sections, elevations, details.
- Convenient for transferring information between similar details, allowing for graphical consistency across the co-located details.
- A detailed model means better ability to schedule information.
- Easier management of details through naming and numbering.
- Easier navigation with the use of source markers, auto-referencing is possible.
- Smaller file size, as details are placed on layouts, not cropped views.
- Details have correct relevant positions when exported in BIMx.
- Best suited for generating the first level (1:20) of details.

DISADVANTAGES
- Anytime there is a change in the model, we must update all the placed 2D elements on the source views of the details, too.
- Details have to be updated to reflect the changes from the model source views.
- Additional layers and layer combinations are needed for elements visible only on the detailing scale.
- Solid white fills are sometimes required to hide information at the margins of the detail so that notes and dimensions can be added.
- Results in a larger Project Map tree, requiring a consistent and logically-structured naming convention to be adopted by the project.
- Generating both levels of details (1:20 and 1:5) using this method can become confusing.
- Not ideal for generating 1:5 details, when these are standardised across the office and not project-specific.
