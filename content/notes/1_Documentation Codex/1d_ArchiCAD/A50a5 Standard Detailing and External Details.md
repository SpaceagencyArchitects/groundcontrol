title: "A50a5 Standard Detailing and External Details"
---
Many manufacturers provide standard details, most commonly in .pdf or .dwg file formats.

We can use these details in a number of ways:

1. Import or link details into a worksheet in ARCHICAD as external drawings or hotlinks and place them onto layouts with other drawings as part of a project documentation set.
2. Link and explode details into a worksheet to edit and embellish them, or add them into model based or drawn details as 2D embelishments.

We also keep standard details in a separate ARCHICAD file (found in the Library section of the spaceagency server), from where we can copy and paste details into a project.
