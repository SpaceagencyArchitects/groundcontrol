### Identity

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [B - Floor and Roof Plans](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/B%20-%20Floor%20and%20Roof%20Plans.md))
- Unique identification tags for each door

##### Door Tag
Door number = room number the door is opening into + a suffix.
e.g. if room No 1234 has one door opening into it, the door number will be 1234.D1 If room No 2345 has three doors opening into it, they will be identified as 2345.D1, 2345.D2 and 2345.D3
Exceptions from the rule: e.g. accessible toilet door opening into corridor – assign door number the same as toilet room number, not corridor
Once the door numbers are assigned, do not change them, e.g. if the door swing changes half way through the documentation, do not change the door number.
