title: "Wall Protection - Room Schedule Scenario"
---
### Identify Wall Protection Systems

#### F - Room Schedule
(see [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md))
- The systems are identified and located by listing the materials and finishes codes under the \| WALL PROTECTION \| criteria

Note: 
There is a strong preference for documenting the wall protection systems in the room schedule. System codes allocated to the rooms in the room schedule spreadsheet
sufficiently describe the wall protection items in the majority of cases.
The NOTE column in the room schedule is used to describe the specific location of an item e.g. ‘CRASH RAIL TRM-02 TO NORTH WALL, HANDRAIL TRM-05 TO SOUTH WALL
For more complex areas instead of trying to code it, write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*
