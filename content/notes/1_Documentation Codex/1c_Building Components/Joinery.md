### Identify joinery items

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [B - Floor and Roof Plans](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/B%20-%20Floor%20and%20Roof%20Plans.md))
Note: There is a strong preference for identifying joinery items in B series **1:100** general arrangement floor plans.
- Joinery items coded, using codes listed in L series legend

### Describe joinery items

#### L - Joinery Plans (1:100)
(see [L - Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment (FFE)](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/L%20-%20Furniture,%20Fixtures,%20Fittings%20and%20Equipment%20(FFE).md))
Note:
As a second preference, in the case where coding of joinery items is not practical in B series, use a separate set of general arrangement drawings
This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in M series, and is used exclusively to identify joinery and FFE items.
- Joinery items coded, using codes listed in L series legend

### Describe Construction

#### L - Legend Sheet - Joinery and Furniture only
