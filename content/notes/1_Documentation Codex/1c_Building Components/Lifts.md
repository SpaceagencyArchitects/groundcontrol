### Describe Lift Car Finishes
Note: 
Lift cars may not need documenting. They are often selected from the lift supplier’s catalogue and design approved upon receipt of contractor’s shop drawings. In such cases design drawing is not required. Description of lift car finishes is required only for bespoke lift car designs, e.g. glazed feature lift.
