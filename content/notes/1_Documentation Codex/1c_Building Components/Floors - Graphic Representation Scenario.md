title: "Floors - Graphic Representation Scenario"

### Identify flooring systems and finishes

#### F - Floor Finishes Plans (1:100)
(see [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md))
- Coded and graphic representation of various flooring systems
- Discrete codes for substrates and for finishes

Note:
In the case where the majority of the floor finishes are too complex to schedule, as a second preference we resort to documenting them through graphic representation. This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in the F series, used exclusively to identify floor finishes.

### Describe Construction and Finishes

#### A - Legend Sheet
(see [A (A0 Introductory documents](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/A%20(A0%20Introductory%20documents.md))
- Key - description of flooring codes; reference to specification section

#### F - Floor Finishes Plans (1:100)
(see [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md))
- Complex areas which are graphically too heavy are referenced to **1:50** plans in G series

#### G - Internal Spaces Floor Plans (1:50)
(see [G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md))
- Describe various areas of different flooring systems, substrates and finishes, using finishes codes
- Make reference to **1:5** details in K series interface details

#### K - Interface Details
(see [K - Interface Details](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/K%20-%20Interface%20Details.md))
- Floor-to-external wall composite section details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
- Flooring (floor-to-floor) details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
- Partitions-to-floors interface composite details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
