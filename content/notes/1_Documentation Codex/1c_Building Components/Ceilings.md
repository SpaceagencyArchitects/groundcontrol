#### F - Room Schedule
(see [Floors - Room Schedule Scenario](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1c_Building%20Components/Floors%20-%20Room%20Schedule%20Scenario.md))
_(Covers most of the areas by allocating finishes code. For more complex areas instead of trying to code it, write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*’)_
- Create columns in room finishes schedule: <span class="caps"> CEILING | Material | Finish | Bulkhead | Material | Finish </span>
- Reference complex areas which can not be scheduled to **1:50** reflected ceiling plans in G series

- Systems and material codes
- Make reference to **1:5** details in K series
