### Identify Signs

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [B - Floor and Roof Plans](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/B%20-%20Floor%20and%20Roof%20Plans.md))
- Identify free standing and wall hung signage items

#### E - Reflected Ceiling Plans (1:100)
(see [E - Reflected Ceiling Plans](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/E%20-%20Reflected%20Ceiling%20Plans.md))

Note: Wayfinding signage elements will be documented by a signage consultant if your job has one - in that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans. Statutory signage (e.g. FIRE DOORS KEEP CLOSED, etc.) is most often associated with the doors and scheduled as part of J series door schedule.
