title: "Wall Finishes"
---
Note: There is a strong preference for documenting the wall finishes in the room schedule.
Finishes codes allocated to the rooms in the room schedule spreadsheet sufficiently describe finishes in the majority of cases.
For more complex internal spaces (e.g. lift lobby, auditorium), instead of trying to code it, draw internal elevations at **1:50** scale in G series and write a note in the schedule ‘FOR
DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*’

### Describe Finishes

#### A - Legend Sheet
(see [A (A0 Introductory documents](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/A%20(A0%20Introductory%20documents.md))
- Key - description of finishes codes; reference to specification section

#### F - Room Schedule
(see [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md))
_(Covers most of the areas by allocating FINISHES code)_
- The wall finishes are described by listing the finishes codes
under the \|WALL/FINISH\| criteria
- Reference complex areas which can not be scheduled to **1:50** plans in G series _(for more complex areas instead of trying to code it, write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*’)_

#### G - Internal Spaces Elevations (1:50, 1:25)
(see[G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md))
