title: "Wall Protection - Graphic Representation Scenario"

### Identify Wall Protection Systems

#### F - Wall Protection General Arrangement Plans (1:100)
(see [F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes](content/notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1b_Alphabet/F%20-%20Floor,%20Wall%20and%20Ceiling%20Finishes.md))
- The wall protection items are identified by pointing coded tags to wall surfaces
- Reference to G series drawings for complex areas

Note: 
As a second preference, in the case where the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (e.g. in health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex, we resort to documenting it through graphic representation.
This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in the F series, used to
graphically represent and identify wall protection systems:
