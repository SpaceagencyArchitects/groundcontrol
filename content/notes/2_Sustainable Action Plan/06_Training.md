Transforming our sustainable design practices will be a joint effort involving all our team members. Spaceagency is committed to supporting our team with the knowledge, training, and resources they need to be successful in our commitment to meeting the 2030 targets.

**ADVANCED TOOL & SOFTWARE TRAINING**

Spaceagency will continue to develop knowledge around energy modelling, and LCA software, share resources and lessons learned, and formulate methods for mentoring other project team members.

**CREDENTIALING & CONTINUING EDUCATION**

All employees, and especially registered architects, are strongly encouraged to pursue lectures, webinars, and conference training on energy use, decarbonisation, and resilient design and planning for continuing education credits. More specialised training related to sustainability within our areas of practice, such as sustainable housing and preservation, environmental justice for Aboriginal communities, etc. is also encouraged. spaceagency will support employees in pursuing Passive House, Living Future, or other professional certifications.

**OPERATIONS**

It is meaningful for us to demonstrate our commitment to reducing GHG emissions through all aspects of how we do business. The measure of these actions may be small relative to that of our entire project portfolio, but they are impactful at the local level, and foster sustained awareness of and advocacy for climate action among our team, consultants, and clients.

As part of our 2030 commitment, we will begin tracking and auditing our firm’s carbon footprint on an annual basis, with the goal of achieving carbon neutral operations and zero waste by 2025.

We intend to advance our sustainability mission and reduce emissions from our practice’s operations in the following three key areas.

1. TRANSPORTATION

Transportation is responsible for more than 25% of Australian GHG emissions annually, and is potentially a significant contributor to our firm’s carbon footprint.

Our studio is in a walkable urban neighbourhood. More than 75% of our team members walk, bike or take public transit to the studio.

We commit to reduce our transportation emissions as follows:

• Minimise project-related motor vehicle travel by using virtual meeting platforms whenever possible.
• Further reduce commuter transportation through flex and remote work policies.
• Continue to encourage employees to use alternative transportation.
• Minimise transportation related to errands and deliveries by combining local trips and online supply orders.

2. ENERGY USE

We commit to reduce emissions from building operations as follows:

• Track and routinely audit utility use at both offices (electricity and water).
• Reduce plug loads by upgrading desktops computers and servers to laptops and cloud-based servers when and wherever possible. Select ENERGY STAR certified computers, copiers, printers and appliances to replace equipment that is more than 5-10 years old.
• Purchase renewable energy or renewable energy credits (RECs), as well carbon offsets for onsite fossil fuel use.

3. MATERIALS

Our practice uses software to track and bill all printing, which greatly reduces unnecessary paper use. We have eliminated the use of single-serving bottled water and recycling programs are in place for paper, glass, plastics, and metals. We use toilet and tissue paper from Who Gives A Crap, an Australian supplier that uses 100% recycled products and donates profits for social good.

We commit to reducing our material use and waste stream as follows:

• Further reduce printing by encouraging the use of pdf software for drawing markups, and phasing out printed marketing materials and business cards.
• Order office supplies from local suppliers whenever possible.
• Purchase environmentally friendly cleaning supplies, and select paper and paper products with a minimum of 30% recycled content.
• Eliminate the use of disposable plastic cutlery and styrofoam food containers.
• Refuse unnecessary product literature and samples from manufacturers, and inquire about take-back programs for materials that are no longer needed.
• Donate and/or recycle all no longer used office electronics, furnishings and supplies.
