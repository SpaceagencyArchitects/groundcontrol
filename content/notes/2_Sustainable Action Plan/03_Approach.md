To achieve these ambitious sustainability objectives, it will be necessary to transform our design practice in a way that is:

**HOLISTIC**
Achieve total carbon reductions through an integrated approach to addressing operational carbon, embodied carbon, and carbon associated with transportation of building users.

**EVIDENCE BASED**
Use baselines, strong targets, iterative modelling, and regular review of project data to evaluate our design decisions and measure progress towards carbon reduction targets.

**PROJECT-WIDE**
Apply new sustainable design processes to all projects, so that we can collectively learn, share, and apply lessons learned across the practice’s project portfolio and to future work.

This will be a journey.  

Outlined below is a design process that will fully apply to all spaceagency projects within 3 years. We will immediately begin using this process to target and achieve energy use reductions in new projects beginning in 2022. By 2025, we will begin to incorporate embodied carbon targets and reporting.

1. ESTABLISH BASELINES & TARGETS AT PROJECT START

Metrics are key to an evidence-based design process. Targets for energy use and embodied carbon are calculated as percentage reductions from established baselines for similar project types. All projects should set firm targets for:

• Predicted energy use intensity, or a target lighting power density or interior remodels not involving HVAC.
• A project carbon budget, expressed in kgCO2e.

2. INTEGRATE PROJECT TEAMS & DESIGN PROCESSES

A holistic approach to sustainable design entails sharing project targets and engaging all consultants and project stakeholders in collaboration, early and throughout the project delivery process. Tools for this include:

• Project briefs to establish and communicate project objectives, basis of design, and commissioning requirements with all parties.
• Design workshops or green charrettes, particularly with MEP consultants to advance creative solutions for energy and water efficiency, and with structural engineers for reducing embodied carbon.

3. INTEGRATE DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION CONSERVATION STRATEGIES

Early design decisions have the greatest impact on building energy use and embodied carbon. Strategies to pursue first include:

• Connected, transit-oriented, dense, and/or urban infill sites.
• Preservation, adaptive re-use, minimising the amount of new construction.
• Building form and orientation, thermal envelope, daylighting, window/ wall ratio, solar shading, natural ventilation, and other low- or no-cost passive design strategies.
• Choosing mass timber, earthen building where possible, and eliminating or optimising the amount of concrete, steel, and aluminium used in building core and shell.

4. INTEGRATE CLEAN, EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY & CARBON SMART MATERIALS

To compliment and further advance carbon reductions achieved through initial design and construction conservation measures:

• Integrate right-sized, high-efficiency MEP systems and advanced controls.
• Advocate for building electrification for occupant health and to eliminate all on-site burning of fossil fuels.
• Specify healthy, renewable, low-carbon and/or carbon sequestering interior materials.

5. OFFSET REMAINING ENERGY DEMANDS & EMBODIED CARBON

After exhausting efficiency and reduction strategies, pursue renewable energy resources and carbon sequestration strategies:

• Incorporate on-site and/or off-site renewable energy production to meet the remaining energy demands.
• Use site and landscape design strategies for carbon sequestration and reduction.

6. EVALUATE, TRACK, & REPORT

Engage in early and iterative modelling to understand the interactive effects of design decisions and assess progress toward meeting energy use and embodied carbon targets. This includes:

• Energy modelling for design and compliance.
• Conducting a whole building life-cycle assessment (LCA).
• Verify targets are being met through commissioning, ongoing monitoring, and during construction procurement.
