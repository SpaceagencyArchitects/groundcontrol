You cannot manage what you do not measure. We recognise that there is tremendous value in evaluating the impact of our design decisions and assessing our progress towards the energy targets we set – on the project level, across the practice’s portfolio, and in relation to the work of our peers nationally.

**EVALUATING OUR CURRENT PROJECT PORTFOLIO**

To better understand our current portfolio and begin measuring progress, we will review the energy use intensity of past projects by sector.

**ENERGY USE AND CARBON REDUCTION GOALS**

Although we do not anticipate a 100% success rate initially, our explicit goal is to meet or exceed net-zero targets by 2030 for energy use for every project. As we begin to measure embodied carbon, we will pursue a 40% reduction from baseline for all projects.

Progress will be measured by improvement over our 2020 project portfolio, and how close our projects come to meeting or exceeding these targets. We aim to complete multiple projects with carbon neutral operations by 2025, and achieve carbon neutral construction in projects by 2030.

**EVALUATION & REPORTING**

We are developing the means to conduct early design phase energy modelling and simulation for energy efficiency, thermal comfort, photovoltaics, and lighting. Design decisions can be iteratively assessed relative to EUI targets established at project start.

Within the next year, we will advance our ability to conduct whole building LCA early and throughout the design process.

Key project metrics - pEUI and carbon budget relative to target values - will be transparent within the firm and across project teams, and will increasingly become a critical dimension of design excellence at spaceagency. 

We will expand our engagement with energy and green building consultants for advanced modelling for code and/or certifications, as well as to pursue greater insight and collaboration in effective carbon mitigation throughout the design process. We will work closely with builders and owners to verify that design targets are being met during construction, procurement, and post-occupancy, and advocate for commissioning and monitoring.
