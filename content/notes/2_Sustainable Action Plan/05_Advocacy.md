The path to solving the worst impacts of climate change runs through the building sector. Individual firms can lead by example, but we must also amplify the impact of our commitment. Among clients, consultants, and the profession at large, it is crucial that we help develop a culture that supports our work, and advances the broader decarbonisation of the built environment, resilient design and planning, and other climate actions.

**SUSTAINABLE DESIGN IS GOOD DESIGN**

We already have the right clients for highly sustainable projects. Just as we already do for thoughtful and beautiful design, we will advocate for and pursue aggressive energy performance, decarbonisation, and resiliency goals on all projects, regardless of budget.  

• Show clients the benefits of reduced operational expenses and project carbon emissions alongside upfront construction costs
• Use the AIA and Architect Declare principles and resources to facilitate conversations with clients and the communities we serve about the value of sustainable, resilient and inclusive design
• Promote our design and thought leadership through social media communications, published articles, and examples of our work

**CULTIVATE A SUSTAINABLE DESIGN NETWORK**

Our success in achieving 2030 goals will depend in part on a network of mutual determination and learning that includes green building, MEP, and structural engineering consultants, as well as peer architecture and planning firms. It is our responsibility to develop new relationships, and encourage existing team members to up their game as we improve ours.

• Identify and engage experienced green building consultants in each practice region
• Strongly encourage the leadership of peer architecture, engineering, and interiors firms to join Architects Declare or other Construction Declares networks
• Join and actively participate in a local AIA Committee on Climate Action

**CREATE CHANGE WITHIN THE PROFESSION AND THE INDUSTRY**

By showing what is possible and within reach, we can advocate for the profession, the industry, and regulation to take urgently needed action on climate.

• Demonstrate design excellence and thought leadership through AIA and other design awards, as well as lectures and speaking engagements at conferences
• Specify healthy, renewable, low-carbon or carbon sequestering building materials, and pressure manufacturers for transparency and environmental product declarations (EPD)
• Advocate for improved building codes and climate policies at local and national level, including natural gas bans and net zero requirements for new construction, mandated energy retrofits for existing buildings, and mass timber code allowances.
