**REGENERATIVE DESIGN**

The diagram below illustrates the steps from conventional building practice, leading to the ultimate goal of regenerative design. While sustainable design aims for carbon neutral buildings, we need to do more to restore and not just sustain.

Regenerative development is defined as “a process by which cities, towns, and other human communities bring themselves back into life-giving alignment with the ecological systems that support them. As a practice, it seeks to create a built environment and human systems that are capable of co-evolving with nature”

**TOOLS TO GET US THERE**

There are a number of frameworks and initiatives to measure environmental efficiency as it relates to buildings. The more widely known are:

Life-cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging as one of the most functional assessment tools used to calculate cradle-to-grave environmental impacts associated with a building. LCA’s consist of a series of modules to assess impacts at various stages of a project. LCA’s are standardised by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 

Whole Life Carbon Assessment is a hybrid LCA assessment encompassing assessments that measure embodied and operational carbon for the life of a building.

NABERS

Rating system for a building’s consumption of energy + water, and emissions of carbon + waste. F+P commonly use this on many projects. This is a good measure of operational carbon.

Green Star

Voluntary rating tool that measures energy, water and material use in buildings, as well as indoor environment quality. Spaceagency are increasingly using this tool in collaboration with specialist consultants

International Well Building Institute

A voluntary global tool measures a building’s performance in human health and wellness. 

Living Building Challenge

Green building certification and sustainable design framework, currently regarded the most rigorous pathway to sustainable building accreditation.

Passive House Institute

Independent research institute involved in the development of the Passive House concept, internationally recognised, performance based energy standard in construction.

Zero Carbon 2030

A global initiative to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, through economic influence.

**THE IMPACT OF OUR BUILDINGS**

While it is evident there are far reaching environmental impacts from the construction sector, operating and embodied energy (or carbon emissions) are of particular concern due to their immediate relationship to global warming and climate breakdown.

Embodied energy (the energy expended to produce and transport a product) can be as high as 40% of a building’s total energy consumption across a 50 year lifespan. Below are some of the ‘big hitters’ when it comes to embodied energy in materials, shown with comparative values (MJ/kg):

170 Aluminium 
32 Steel  
5.6 Cement
3.6 AAC (Autoclaved aerated concrete) 
70 PVC 
12.7 Glass
2.5 Bricks

Operational energy, (the energy required to operate a building) accounts for the remaining 60% of energy - and therefore carbon - produced over the lifetime of a building. Approaches to reduce operational carbon emissions include reduction and offsetting. At spaceagency we see offsetting as a last resort, only to be entertained when every other avenue to minimise embodied carbon has been exhausted.

The table below shows the relative contribution over the life cycle of a building.

**HOW EXPENSIVE ARE ‘GREEN BUILDINGS’?**

The expected business benefits of green buildings in Australia in 2018 are significant:

-   Decreased operating costs over one year is 9% for new buildings and 11% for retro-fits
-   Decreased operating costs over five years is 27% for new buildings and 15% for retro-fits
-   The payback time was 7 years for new green buildings and 6 years for green retro-fits

We’ve categorised the environmental impacts into the broader targets areas of action as listed below:

**ENERGY, WATER, HABITAT AND HEALTHY BUILDINGS  
**Our specific targets for each of these are listed on page 7.
