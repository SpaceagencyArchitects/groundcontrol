Spaceagency recognises environmental design as integral to our journey towards a regenerative built environment. We are continually researching means of deliver better buildings that consider all contexts, from cultural and historical to environmental and experiential.

Spaceagency is committed to taking on all eleven principles of the Architects Declare movement. 

**_Our primary objective is to achieve zero net carbon by 2030 within all our projects. We recognise this as our top priority to meet the critical climate challenge of reducing the global temperature increase to a maximum +1.5°C._**

The following pages outline how we intend to achieve this objective and our immediate strategy for action. 

We are committed to raise awareness of the need for sustainability as a ‘minimum standard’ within our industry, including our clients, suppliers, consultants, contractors and building users. It starts with raising the issue at the feasibility and concept phases of the design process and maintaining clear goals with the consultant team throughout design development and documentation. Upon project completion, it continues by integrating information or visually expressing the regenerative strategies for the building users, and by presenting completed projects to peers and sharing lessons learned.

We advocate for faster industry change and carbon emission reduction by asking our suppliers to recognise and minimise the impact of their products and giving priority to those who do. We continue to be as visible as we can in the current discussions and forums that highlight issue of climate change and demand industry change.

We champion upgrade, re-use and recycling, rather than demolishing and re-building. We find that the greater co-ordination challenges are offset, not just by cost and material savings, but by more unique and place specific solutions. We thrive on the thoughtful co-ordination between existing and new elements.

We are establishing mitigation principles to counter climate change and biodiversity loss. Our goal is for all future projects to achieve sustainability ratings, at minimum, from established organisations such as NABERS, WELLS and Green Star, but preferably more holistic and rigorous such as One Planet Living and the Living Building Challenge. To achieve this goal we evaluate each project using various analytical tools, rich contextual research and project team collaboration to create individualised solutions using the most suitable sustainability strategies.

The inclusion of life-cycle costing, carbon modelling, and post-occupancy evaluation are not currently standard, but we are reviewing available tools to best provide the data we need.

This collaboration and life-cycle analysis goes hand-in-hand with the desire to reduce material and resource waste, and carbon emissions across the whole-of-life cycle of our buildings, from design to occupation and finally de-commission.

We are committed to establishing a regenerative design strategy within the next five years, so that regenerative design principles will become an essential part of all our projects.

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN OBJECTIVES:

**1. REDUCED EMISSIONS THROUGH PRESERVATION & ADAPTIVE RE-USE**
The greenest building is one that is already built. Preserving and re-using existing buildings avoids a considerable portion of the embodied carbon emissions associated with equivalent new construction, building materials, and site development, as well as associated transportation emissions over the life of the project.

**2. LASTING VALUE THROUGH HIGH-PERFORMANCE DESIGN**
Low- and no-cost passive design strategies - like thermal envelope, controlled solar gain, daylighting, and natural ventilation - combined with efficient MEP systems and on- or off-site renewable energy resources, yield new buildings and major renovations that prioritise human comfort and dramatically reduce operational emissions and expenses for the owners and communities they serve.

**3. INCREASED RESILIENCE THROUGH CARBON-SMART CONSTRUCTION**
Thoughtful approaches to renewable materials, supply chains, and methods of construction can minimise cost, dramatically reduce carbon footprints, and support local labor and regional manufacturing. Designing buildings to be durable assets and to anticipate inevitable change, eventual deconstruction, and the re-use of their components ensures that they can support the institutions and communities they are a part of, for generations to come.
