spaceagency have developed this Sustainability Action Plan (SAP) as part of signing onto the Architects Declare commitment in January 2020.
This SAP is part of our practice’s commitment and approach to sustainable design, and an actionable strategy for developing best practice, evaluating progress and communicating our values to clients and peers.

The SAP is a roadmap for spaceagency to:

● Prioritize energy performance, carbon reductions, and resilience in our work, with the goal of moving our entire project portfolio towards carbon neutral buildings, developments, and renovations by 2030.
● Transform our approach to sustainable design and our working process to be holistic and evidence driven in order to meet the 2030 targets.
● Measure the carbon impacts of our design decisions, assess progress across our firm’s portfolio and in relation to our peers.
● Advocate for sustainable design with clients, consultants, and our peers.
● Train employees, and develop a robust culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
● Track operations with the goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2030.  

We recognise that is is essential that we all do dramatically more to urgently reconsider how and what we build and replenish our planet’s capacity to thrive. This action plan arises our of our commitment to Architects Declare’s sustainability principles.

This document defines our studio’s current design and operational methods as they relate to sustainability and our proposed improvements. It also includes a review of our current research, education and advocacy strategies and defines a time-line for improved performance in these areas.

The action plan will be reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. We’re also prepared to share our knowledge and experiences with our peers and other industry professionals.

**_We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of Country, the Whadjuk Noongar people and recognise their continuing connection to land, waters and culture. We pay respect to Elders past and present and extend this respect to all Aboriginal people living in or visiting the area._**

_“The twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss are the most serious issue of our time. Globally, buildings and construction play a major part, accounting for nearly 40% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions whilst also having a significant impact on our natural habitats._

_For everyone working in the construction industry, meeting the needs of our society without breaching the earth’s ecological boundaries will demand a paradigm shift in our behaviour. Together with our clients, we will need to commission and design buildings, cities and infrastructures as indivisible components of a larger, constantly regenerating and self-sustaining system._

_The research and technology exist for us to begin that transformation now, but what has been lacking is collective will. Recognising this, we are committing to strengthen our working practices to create architecture and urbanism that has a more positive impact on the world around us.”_
