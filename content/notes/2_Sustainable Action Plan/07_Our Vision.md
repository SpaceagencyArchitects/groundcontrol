**Carbon positive buildings.**

The climate crisis is real and we need to take urgent and drastic action to limit global warming.

The construction industry is a major contributor to environmental impact, and it’s now imperative we take action. As responsible professionals, we have leverage and agency to do this.

The goal is regenerative design: reversing the damage of the past and contributing more than has been removed.


**_We will strive to do better than yesterday and be part of the solution_**. **We choose the planet.**  

**THE FRAMEWORK: ARCHITECTS DECLARE 11 GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

Architect’s Declare is a voluntary global movement, started in the UK in 2019, declaring climate and biodiversity emergencies and asking architects to commit to the following principles:

-   Raise awareness of the climate and biodiversity emergencies and the urgent need for action amongst our clients and supply chains. 
-   Advocate for faster change in our industry towards regenerative design practices and a higher Governmental funding priority to support this. 
-   Establish climate and biodiversity mitigation principles as the key measure of our industry’s success: demonstrated through awards, prizes and listings. 
-   Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis. 
-   Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. 
-   Upgrade existing buildings for extended use as a more carbon efficient alternative to demolition and new build whenever there is a viable choice. 
-   Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use. 
-   Adopt more regenerative design principles in our studios, with the aim of designing architecture and urbanism that goes beyond the standard of net zero carbon in use. 
-   Collaborate with engineers, contractors and clients to further reduce construction waste. 
-   Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. 
-   Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, both in quantum and in detail. 

In Australia, we as architects are aware that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long espoused the cultural, social, economic and environmental benefits embedded in the holistic relationship of Caring for Country.

Each signatory should define their current location and a develop a plan to improve. The degree of commitment by an architectural practice to these 11 principles, defines the level of the Sustainability Action Plan (SAP).

**REVIEW:**

**A firm who has signed the declaration but whose work or practices are not consistently meeting the goals of the movement.**

**EXTEND:**

**_A firm whose business operations and projects consistently align with the majority of the architects declare principles but who do not have a formalised approach that captures all aspects of the business._**

**_AMPLIFY:_**

**A firm well versed in sustainability and a leader in the field in terms of projects and advocacy.**

**REGENERATE:**

**A more broadly recognised leader in advocacy and action, whose SAP tackles areas beyond the profession.**

Spaceagency are currently at the ‘EXTEND’ level, moving towards ‘AMPLIFY’.
