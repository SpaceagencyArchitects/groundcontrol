title: "09_2030 Performace Targets"
---
In order to track our progress we must measure our output across the industry. We must also aim for evidence based targets that are proportional to the challenge of limiting global warming to 1.5C.

Spaceagency has therefore adopted the following target for 2030:

**ENERGY  
Reduce green-house gas emissions by**
• reducing operation carbon to 0 kWh/ m2/ y  
• reducing embodied carbon by 40% compared to 2020 levels

**WATER**

• preserve this limited resource by reducing potable water use to <10 litres/person/day 

**HABITAT**

Save our natural environment by:
-   BIODIVERSITY: Leaving a site in better condition than pre-development and maximising green cover. 
-   BIRD LIFE: Minimising harm through careful selection of materials (eg glazing).

**HEALTHY BUILDINGS**  
Create healthy buildings for healthy humans: 

-   OVERHEATING: limit to 25-28°C maximum for 1% of occupied hours 
-   DAYLIGHTING: >2% avg. daylight factor, 0.4 uniformity 
-   CO2 LEVELS: <900 ppm 
-   TOTAL VOCS: <0.3 mg/ m3 
-   FORMALDEHYDE: <0.1 mg/ m3 


**THE IMPACT OF OUR BUILDINGS**

**CURRENT PRACTICE**

Spaceagency was an early signatory to the Australian Architects Declare movement and our team member Tobias Busch was steering group member from 2020 through to 2022. 

We stand with other Declare professionals, voicing our concern about the environmental and ecological disasters we are currently facing and committing to the construction of buildings which positively contribute to the future of the planet.

We already have considerable experience with green building standards, having delivered 4 and 5-Star Green Star residential buildings in Perth, designed a co-operative housing project within the One Planet Living framework and are currently collaborating on a number of projects aiming for Climate Active certification. Green Star, NABERS and WELL ratings are standard in most of our projects and we are currently reviewing the adoption of the Living Building Challenge and Passive House standards.

Our studio includes people who are champions of sustainable and regenerative design and lifestyles and are actively researching and collaborating to develop new systems, approaches and products within the field.
