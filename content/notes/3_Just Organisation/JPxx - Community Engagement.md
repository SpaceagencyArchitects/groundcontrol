# Policy

Spaceagency conducts business on the unceded lands of the Wadjuk Noongar people. We pay our respects to their elders past and present, acknowledging their intimate bonds with country and their sustainable land

practices from which we can learn a great deal. We recognise the impact that our built interventions can have on local Indigenous communities and their land. The built environment is a key pillar of the enduring context of

colonisation in Australia and we strive to remain aware of this dynamic in both our design and construction processes. We will listen to and incorporate Indigenous voices wherever possible and always remain open to how we can improve in this area.

We strive to create architecture and urban design that integrates with and supports local communities. Stakeholder consultation is a key component of our design process. We conduct workshops that allow local communities and user groups to share their opinions and ideas. These stakeholders provide invaluable knowledge and unique perspectives that enable a deeper understanding of a project, allowing us to create more responsive design outcomes. This process leads to a greater sense of ownership for end users of a design that acknowledges their local needs and values.
