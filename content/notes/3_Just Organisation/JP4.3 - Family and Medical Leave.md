1.  Organisation has written and posted public policy on Family and Medical Leave. 

# Policy

**Parental Leave** 

All qualifying employees are entitled to paid and unpaid parental leave in accordance with Australian legislation. 
Employees may also be eligible to claim the Australian Government Financial support for up to 18 weeks to help working parents care for a newborn or recently adopted child.

**Personal (Sick & Carers) Leave**
Employees are entitled to paid personal leave in accordance with Australian legislation. An employee can take paid personal leave when they can’t work because of a personal illness or injury. This can include stress and pregnancy related illnesses. An employee can take paid personal leave to care for or support a member of their immediate family or household who is sick, injured or has an unexpected emergency. Employees are entitled to 10 paid days per year of full-time employment and a pro-rata of 10 paid days each year. Personal leave is accumulative and carries over to the next year if unused.

**Family and Domestic Violence Leave** 
Spaceagency provide up to 5 days unpaid leave per year for Family and Domestic violence related issues to all staff, including part-time and casual staff. Staff who are affected are encouraged to access working arrangements which best suit their needs by discussing matters with a senior staff member. All disclosures and activities are kept confidential. 

**Other Health Circumstances** 
Spaceagency recognises that certain individuals may have ongoing health issues which impact their ability to work and utilise sick/carers leave as intended, for unforeseen issues. We encourage staff to speak with a senior staff member, so a solution may be discussed and agreed. 

**Flexible Work** 
In order to support work/life balance and the needs of families, spaceagency will provide the following flexible work arrangements if they can be accommodated without detriment to the employee, team or organisation: 

-   Condensed work weeks (e.g. four 10-hour workdays) 
-   Customised working hours (e.g. 7am to 3pm workday)
