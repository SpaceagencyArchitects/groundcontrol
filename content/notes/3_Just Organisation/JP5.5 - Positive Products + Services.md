# Policy

Our vision is to make a positive difference to the health and happiness of peopleâ€™s lives through the quality of every environment we contribute to. We strive for an integrated architecture that is visually enriching, socially responsive and ecologically restorative. Our approach to building and urban design considers biophilic design strategies that foster beneficial contact between people and nature. Contact with nature is directly related to levels of health, cognitive functioning, healthy childhood maturation, greater community and sense of place and enhanced coping and effective behaviour. We endeavour to demonstrate the potential for environmentally sustainable design principles with an emphasis on low embodied energy and material use, water conservation and waste management. We commit to maintaining a portfolio of which a majority of projects (by revenue) contribute to the betterment of society and the environment.
