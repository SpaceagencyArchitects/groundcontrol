## Additional Support / Context

In Australia, retirement income is funded through a mix of personal savings, a government pension and superannuation (Super).

Super is made up of employer contributions called Super Guarantee) which is compulsory and an employee’s own personal contributions (not compulsory). Super Guarantee (SG) is a compulsory contribution made by all employers on behalf of each of their eligible employees. The contribution is paid directly to each employee’s nominated super fund, or a default fund. The amount paid is set at a percentage of each employee’s Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE). The Australian Government determines the Super Guarantee rate which, in 2021, is set at 10% of OTE. OTE generally includes the employee's regular wage plus any shift loadings, commissions, paid leave and some allowances. Superannuation must be 'preserved' until your preservation age which is currently between 55 and 60, depending on when you were born. When you reach preservation age, you can access your super as long as you are permanently retired (or reached age 65).

When you have reached retirement age and stop working, your super fund is usually converted to a pension which will give the employee money to live on.
