## Additional Support / Context

Australia is currently witnessing a significant increase in the burden of chronic disease. A 2010 AIHW report found that 96% of working-age Australians had at least one chronic disease risk factor and 72% had multiple risk factors. The modifiable risk factors causing the greatest disease burden are tobacco smoking, alcohol misuse, poor diet, physical inactivity and unhealthy weight. As major contributors to chronic disease, these risk factors lead to reduced productivity and participation in the workforce and the community and place great pressure on the Australian healthcare system. There is also a recognised two-way causal relationship between many of these risk factors and mental disorders such as depression.

The benefits of physical health are supported by compelling evidence from National and International studies.

A study undertaken by Medibank Private revealed that:
- Organisations that implement health promotion strategies in the workplace can reduce their workers’ health risk factors by up to 56%;
- Productivity gains of up to 15% can be achieved by upgrading the workplace environment; and
- The average worker is up to 7% less productive because of their health risks.
