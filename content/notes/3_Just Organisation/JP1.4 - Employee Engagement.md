Spaceagency is committed to creating a workplace in which all staff feel motivated, engaged and supported. We use both formal and informal methods to ensure employee engagement. We aim to employ open and honest communication and provide staff with regular and constructive feedback. Project and team meetings provide opportunities for staff to understand and be involved in decisions that affect their work. Regular in-house tutorials and workshops are also available to staff for training and development. 

Our formal appraisal process comprises two parts: The Preview, and the Retrospective + 360 Feedback. Occurring at the beginning of each year, the Preview presents staff with an opportunity to set goals for the coming twelve months. These aspirations are discussed with a supervisor to ascertain the training and development opportunities that may be required. The Retrospective + 360 Feedback is a performance review that occurs in the middle of each year. This process involves an exchange between staff who provide feedback on each other’s performance. This reflexive approach provides staff with helpful and honest feedback to advance their professional development. We hope that these methods combine to form a workplace culture of openness, trust and support in which all employees feel engaged. 

We aim to achieve employee engagement by continuingly promoting and working to improve the following areas:

+ Clear job descriptions which are linked to the wider team and organisation goals which show employees how their role contributes to the wider strategic objectives.
+ Diversity such as ethnic, gender, age and sexual orientation and creating a culture of inclusion and participation.
+ Family friendly policies such as working from home and flexible working hours.
+ Work life balance.
+ Performance based compensation reward and recognition programs.
+ Environmental sustainability.
+ Learning and Development including provision of study assistance.
+ Career progression and support.
+ Interesting and challenging work that grows our employees experience and capabilities.
+ Creating a working environment which is free from harassment and where everyone is treated with dignity, courtesy and respect.
+ Social Events.
+ Mental Health support and promotion.
- Regular open and honest communication and feedback.
- Regular performance reviews offering an ongoing opportunity for employees and managers to plan, monitor and review employee’s work objectives and overall alignment and contribution to the wider strategic business goals. This provides an open communication platform between employees and managers about what the employee is expected to accomplish, while also enabling conversations around employee learning and development and career progression.
+ Support to implement the latest industry technological advancement to improve our work performance.
