title: "JP2.2 - Pay Scale Equity"
---
Level 4

# Policy

Spaceagency is committed to pay scale equity. We are aware of the trend that relates to income inequality and the historical overvaluation of work performed by senior level job classifications and the undervaluation of work performed by employees in junior level job classifications. While spaceagency recognises that there are merited differences in employee compensation within and between an organisationâ€™s levels of employees, we place an equitable limit on the compensation ratio between the lowest and highest paid employee of 1:15. This policy does not preclude the organisation from making discretionary payments to any employee based on performance or other merit-based factors.
