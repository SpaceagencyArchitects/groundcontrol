# Policy
(Note: below is a joint policy for Ethnic Diversity, Gender Diversity and Inclusion metrics)

Spaceagency recognises the value of a diverse workplace is committed to fostering an inclusive environment. Our human capital is the most valuable asset we have. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our diverse employees invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture, but our reputation, goodwill and long-term success. We aim to create a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment where full participation is valued and voices from diverse backgrounds and perspectives are heard. 

We recognise, embrace and celebrate our employees’ differences in age, colour, race, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, religious affiliation, socio-economic status, citizenship status and other identities that make our employees unique. 

Our core principles are to encourage: 

- Respectful communication and cooperation between all employees 
- Teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all groups and employee perspectives 
- Work/life balance through flexible work schedules to accommodate employees’ varying needs 
- Employer and employee contributions to the communities we serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for traditionally underserved and historically marginalised populations 
- Acceptance of cultural, religious or personal beliefs and practices 

We are focused on providing a culture and work environment where racially and ethnically diverse employees have the opportunity to be successful in their careers and to be represented at all levels of the organisation including senior leadership. 

We are taking steps to provide a culture which does not limit opportunities provided to all women, both trans and cis, and are committed to ongoing mentorship and sponsorship of all women employees. Gender diversity may also include individuals who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. We are accepting of all members of LGBTIQ+ communities and endeavour to ensure that opportunities for success are not limited by identity. 

We are an equal opportunity employer and endeavour to support any staff with disabilities and/or health needs, including mental health, and recognise our responsibilities to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace or working arrangements so that our employees can do their job safely and effectively. 

All employees of DesignInc have a responsibility to treat others with dignity, empathy, kindness, courtesy and respect at all times. All employees are expected to exhibit conduct that reflects inclusion during work, at work functions, on or off the work site and at all other organisation-sponsored and participative events. Behaviour, actions or words that transgress the policy will not be tolerated and will be dealt with in line with the practice’s disciplinary procedure. 

As a practice we aim to provide an inclusive, diverse and supportive environment through: 

- Gender pay equity 
- Flexible and part-time work availability 
- Discouraging ‘long hours’ culture 
- Supporting career breaks 
- Supporting career progression 
- Providing mentorship + role models 

DesignInc is a proud member of the Male Champions of Change program and is committed to actively advancing gender equity in our practice and profession. Guided by the Australian Institute of Architects Gender Equity Taskforce, DesignInc commits to meet the expectation of the 40:40:20 Campaign: 40 per cent women, 40 per cent men, and 20 per cent discretionary employees. 

## Additional Support / Context

DesignInc recognises the contemporary challenges which face women and those from minorities both within the profession and within broader social and cultural spheres. We note the stark contrast between the diversity of Australian society and the diversity of Australian leadership. 

In Australia, women have made up nearly half of all architecture graduates since the mid-1990s. Yet women make up just 25 percent of all registered architects and 13 percent of all directors. DesignInc currently (Oct 2019) comprises 56 percent women employees. DesignInc Senior Leadership currently (Oct 2019) comprises 17 percent women. 

32 percent of Australians have a non-Anglo-Celtic background, yet they only accounted (in 2016) for five percent of ASX 200 CEOs, four percent of federal parliamentarians, and fewer than two percent of senior positions in federal and state public service departments. They occupied zero university vice-chancellor positions and zero federal ministerial positions. Meanwhile, those with an Anglo-Celtic background filled between 76 and 86 percent of roles in the same categories. 

Australian 2016 Census concluded that 28.5 percent of people living in greater Melbourne have a non-Anglo-Celtic (white) background. Approximately 36 percent of people living in greater Melbourne were born somewhere other than Australia. Australia’s racial minority are Aboriginal peoples, Torres Strait Islanders and South Sea Islanders, with the community in greater Melbourne at less than 1 percent (0.6%). 

DesignInc conducted an ethnic diversity exercise in which staff shared their family background and place of birth. Approximately 35 percent of staff identified as being of a non-Anglo-Celtic background. Approximately 34 percent of staff identified as being born somewhere other than Australia. Currently no one at DesignInc identifies as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander or South Sea Islander. 

After conducting an internal survey, we report an average staff inclusion score of 7.65 out of 10.
