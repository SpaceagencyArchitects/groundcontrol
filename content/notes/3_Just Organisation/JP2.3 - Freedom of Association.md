# Policy

Spaceagency supports freedom of association and the value of collective representation and bargaining. We recognise the right to collective bargaining is the key to the representation of collective interests. It builds on freedom of association and renders collective representation meaningful. Collective bargaining can play an important role in enhancing enterprise performance, managing change and building harmonious employer-employee relations. 

Spaceagency employees have the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and they also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labour organisation as a condition of employment. Employees of spaceagency will not be discriminated against due to membership and participation in labour unions.

## Additional Support / Context

Spaceagency as a practice is a member of both the Association of Consulting Architects (ACA) and the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). The ACA is an employer-representative and leads the discussion on business and employment matters in Australian architecture. The AIA is the peak body for the architecture profession in Australia representing over 11,500 members globally and dedicated to improving the built environment and communities by promoting quality, responsible, sustainable design.  
Professional Architects Australia is the employee-representative union for architectural workers, providing legal representation and collective bargaining for members.
