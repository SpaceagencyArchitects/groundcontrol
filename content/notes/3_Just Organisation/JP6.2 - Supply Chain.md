# Policy

Spacaegency is committed to referencing the SA8000:2014 standard to manage the social performance of our supply chain. The standard reflects labour provisions contained within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. The SA8000:2014 standard measures social performance in eight key areas important to social accountability in workplaces, anchored by a management system element that drives continuous improvement in all areas of the standard. These areas include: 

- Child Labour 
- Forced or Compulsory Labour 
- Health and Safety 
- Freedom of Association 
- Discrimination 
- Disciplinary Practices 
- Working Hours 
- Remuneration 

Spaceagency will not engage with any consultant organisations through our supply chain that we believe to be conducting poor social practices such as breaches of Human Rights or International Labour conventions. 
Prior to engagement with any new consultant, spaceagency will take reasonable steps to ensure that the other organisation has not breached any Human Rights or corporate social responsibility guidelines. This includes: 

- Professional references and enquiries 
- Independent online enquiry 
- Internal record keeping and mapping of supply chain 

Spaceagency will not engage with any organisation that we believe to have breached Human Rights or corporate social responsibilities.
