# Policy

Spaceagency recognises the positive impact that financial assistance can create for communities. We therefore commit to donating 1 percent of net profits annually to a registered charitable or not-for-profit organisation chosen by staff. We preference organisations that demonstrate evidence of positive social and environmental impact, with a clear focus on diversity and equity. All staff members can provide input into the selection of charities.
