# Policy

Medicare is Australia's universal health care system, which is the primary health scheme that subsidises most medical costs in Australia for all Australian citizens and permanent residents. 
Medicare covers the cost of public hospital services. It also covers some or all costs of other health services, including services provided by GPs and medical specialists, physiotherapy, community nurses and basic dental services for children. 
Services not covered by Medicare may be covered, in whole or in part, by voluntary private health insurance, which is also subsidised by the federal government.
Spaceagency does not make any additional financial contributions to health insurance for employees.
