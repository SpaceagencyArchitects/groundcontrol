# Policy

Spaceagency values the ongoing training and development of staff. We encourage staff to undertake learning and development activities, including training courses, seminars, briefings, workshops, conferences, formal courses, mentoring or on-the-job coaching. 
Spaceagency may suggest specific training but employees are also encouraged to propose training opportunities they would like to be engaged in. Training/education proposals will be assessed on a case by case basis. 
Spaceagency has allocated $500 per employee per calendar year for training and continuing education purposes. The support provided can include directly paying tuition and fees, conference registration, travel, lodging and expenses. Spaceagency will pay employees their standard wage or salary while participating in approved educational activities scheduled over the course of a standard work week.
