# Policy

Spaceagency promotes the emotional and psychological wellbeing of our employees to foster a healthy, supportive work environment. We are committed to creating a work environment and atmosphere that allows employees to feel recognised as multi-dimensional, complex and evolving individuals. 

We are committed to providing the following components: 

– Flexible work arrangements 

-   Breaks - Staff are encouraged to take breaks during the day for meals of at least 30 minutes and also taking time away from their workstations during the day.
-   Leave - Staff are encouraged to use their annual leave during the year and use their sick leave i they are not well.
-   After Hours Disconnect – Employees are discouraged from engaging in work-related email, phone calls or other work during paid-time off (including weekends and evenings).
-   Gender Neutral Bathrooms – We acknowledge the diversity and differing needs of employees, so our bathroom is gender neutral.
-   + Use of sick or paid time including adjustments to their work schedule for treatment, appointments or other mental health needs.
-   + Individualised adjustment of the physical environment to support mental health needs.
-   + Increased interpersonal support (e.g., manager support with prioritising and managing workloads, increased frequency of one-on-one check-ins).

– Social events, including: 

— Informal office presentations
