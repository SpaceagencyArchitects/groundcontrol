# Policy

Refer to JP1.1 Gender Diversity for joint Diversity and Inclusion Policy

Inclusion is critical to all areas of our business from recruitment, training, pay equity, succession planning, engagement and retention.
Spaceagency’s recruitment / succession plan policy is about hiring “The Right Person for the Job”.
To ensure pay equity, employees performing the same role are paid the same amount, and employees performing different work of equal or comparable value are paid equitably.
This ensures that all our employee’s skills, responsibilities and working conditions are valued in a non-discriminatory way.
To help our employees balance their work-life commitments and their life outside the workplace, spaceagency offers employees flexible work arrangements such as working from home and flexible start / finish times.
Spaceagency also promotes authenticity, we want our employees to feel comfortable coming to work as their “True Self” and not repressing themselves to feel that they fit in.
