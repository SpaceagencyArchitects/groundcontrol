# Policy

Spaceagency is committed to the philosophy of animal compassion and welfare. We believe that we have an intrinsic duty to prevent the harm, abuse and torture of animals. In order to better safeguard the welfare of animals and to develop a higher level of empathy for their plight, we support the following policies and practices: 

-   Provide a companion / support animal friendly workplace 
-   Give preference to specifying non-animal-based materials and products in our work 
-   Ensure catering menus for internal and external functions are at least 50 percent plant-based. If the menu is not 100% plant-based, supplemental menu items must be plant-forward and contain only certified humane animal products 
-   Purchase supplies, materials and ingredients that have not been tested on animals 
-   Do not conduct any animal testing or experimentation 
-   Do not engage in business with services or companies that participate in the abusive treatment of animals, animal testing or factory farm facilities.
