# Policy

Spaceagency is committed to providing permanent full-time and part-time employment as the primary basis of our workforce. We understand the value in offering our employees stable, on-going employment with full benefits.

All employees are hired on a permanent, full-time employment agreement with the exception

of temporary staff hired on an adhoc casual basis and architecture and interior design student interns on work

experience placement from university.

Spaceagency does not employ paid or unpaid interns.

Spaceagency believes that flexible working arrangements may be important for work / life balance of some employees and encourage all staff to pursue working arrangements which best suit their needs. Examples of reasons staff have pursued alternate working arrangements: 
- Interest in other creative pursuits 
- Personal health and/or wellbeing reasons 
- Personal business opportunities 
- Parental care 
- Family support / care 
- Tutoring/ Lecturing 
- Involvement in industry related conference, board, panel participation 
- Involvement in industry related research projects 

Examples of flexible arrangements available to all employees include: 
- Condensed work weeks (e.g. four 10-hour workdays) 
- Customised working hours (e.g. 7am to 3pm workday) 
- Telecommuting (e.g. employees work one or two days a week from home)  

We support career breaks and parental leave and are working to tackle the problem of ‘false part-time syndrome’ for part-time employees. We actively discourage all employees from working unpaid over-time. All over-time must be pre-agreed and will be reimbursed as Time-In-Lieu or paid overtime as specified by the Architects Award. 

## Additional Support / Context

Spaceagency has a total of 6 staff as of March 2022. Of this total 2 are employed on a part-time basis. 

**Permanent Full-time Employees** work 37.5 hours per week, as per the employee agreement. Permanent full-time employees are eligible for all leave, overtime, flexible working arrangements and superannuation benefits set out in the employment agreement. 

**Permanent Part-time Employees** work fewer than 37.5 hours per week and are eligible for all flexible working arrangements and overtime benefits as well as pro-rated leave and superannuation benefits. 

**Fixed Term Contract Employees** are employed for a specific period or task. For example, a 6-month contract where employment ends after 6 months. Fixed term contract employees are usually full-time or part-time employees. Full-time or part-time fixed term employees are entitled to the same wages, penalties and leave as permanent employees as described in the employee agreement. 

**Casual Employees** do not have a firm commitment in advance from an employer about how long they will be employed for, or the days (or hours) they will work. A casual employee also does not commit to all work an employer might offer. Casual employees are entitled to a higher pay rate than equivalent full-time or part-time employees. This is called a 'casual loading' and is paid because they do not receive benefits such as sick or annual leave. A casual employee can change to full-time or part-time employment at any time if the employer and employee both agree to it.
