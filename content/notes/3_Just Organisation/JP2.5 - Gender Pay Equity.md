title: "JP2.5 - Gender Pay Equity"
---
**Level 2/3?**

# Policy

Spaceagency’s gender pay scale equity is based on the Australian Government Workplace Gender Equality Agency - Guide to Gender Pay Equity and equal remuneration between women and men under the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012.
Spaceagency is committed to eliminating systemic bias and discrimination that relates to the historical undervaluation of work performed by women and other non-male genders.

We are committed to ensuring that: 
– men and women performing the same work are paid the same amount 

– men and women performing different work of equal value are paid the same amount 

– the wages and conditions of jobs are assessed in a non-discriminatory way. This is done by valuing skills, responsibilities and working conditions in each job or job type (even where the work itself is different) and remunerating employees accordingly 

– we address gender biases in hiring, promotion, performance and pay decisions 

– organisational structures and processes do not impede employees of any gender access to work-based training, promotions or flexible working arrangements. 

Spaceagency wages for positions within the practice are reviewed annually and allocate pay based on the role, irrespective of gender. 

We acknowledge our practice’s structure at the time of forming this policy. As a practice we recognise that equality extends beyond parity and that promotion of women into senior leadership positions is desirable in reducing the gender pay gap.

  

  

  

**Additional Support/Context**

Gender equity pay scale data: 

– Directors: (no gap analysis and fewer than 4 positions) 

– Project arch/leaders: 5.7% (female adv) 

– Graduates: 3.6% (male advantage) 

  

Note from JUST: Singular positions such as CEO, COO, executive director, etc., can be excluded from the calculations. Pay classes with no gender diversity can be excluded. Pay classes with fewer than four employees can be excluded.

**Gender Pay Gap** 

Spaceagency commits to transparency of its Gender Pay Gap (GPG). The GPG measures the difference between the average earnings of women and men in the workforce. It is not the difference between two people being paid differently for work of the same or comparable value.

The GPG is an internationally established measure of women’s position in economy in comparison to men. It is the result of the social and economic factors that combine to reduce women’s earning capacity over their lifetime. 

Spaceagency’s GPG is 18% (male adv) 

**Interpreting the Gap** 

Our pay gap is not an equal pay issue. Men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the practice. 

At spaceagency the gender pay gap is influenced by several factors, including: 

– higher number of women working part-time 

– higher number of men in senior, higher-paid roles
